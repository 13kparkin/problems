Challenge: Palindrome Checker

Write a function or program that takes a string as input and checks whether it is a palindrome or not. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward, ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization.

Example:

Input: "radar"
Output: True (It is a palindrome)

Input: "Hello, World!"
Output: False (It is not a palindrome)

Input: "Able was I ere I saw Elba"
Output: True (It is a palindrome)

Make sure to handle spaces, punctuation, and capitalization properly while checking for palindromes.
